Density is critical to the viability of transit; the reason the New York subway system is economically viable is that there are a lot of people per stop. I think it's important for people who care about the climate to explain that to their fellow citizens.

Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists \"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.\" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic.

       " 'In the interest of understanding each other, I will include my comments as they were written for this article.\\\\n\\\\nHi Rachel,\\\\n\\\\nIn brief, I have quite a few concerns about the Commissioner\\\\\\'s approach, namely that pursuing density without adequate protections in place to prevent displacement and invest in community stability for existing residents (in particular low-income renters, communities of color) puts us on the wrong path to being the next San Francisco where hardly anyone of modest income can afford to live. Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a \"sustainable, equitable\" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment.',\n",

This is a crucial first step--but still just a first step--in giving the city the tools and underlying mandates necessary to better confront the problem. There's a long way to go in removing state-level pre-emptions on rent control, inclusionary zoning, and the minimum wage--all things that impact the ability of people to afford living in the city. \\\\n\\\\nI am happy to talk more about this today over the phone, but would also be happy to field questions over email if that's easier.\\\\n\\\\nAll the best,\\\\n\\\\nAdam\",\n",

We aren\\\\\\'t requiring that enough social good be done. And when we try to incentivize social good instead of require it, it is comes in measures far too inadequate to do much to solve the problems we\\\\\\'re facing.
